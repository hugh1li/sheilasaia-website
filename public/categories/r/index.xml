      <description>Background While attending rstudio::conf 2018, I heard about the tibbletime package developed by Davis Vaughan and Matt Dancho for analysis of time series data. In his conference talk, Davis Vaughan presented several business/finance examples to showcase tibbletime’s functionality and mentioned a few, general non-business applications at the end of his talk. I couldn’t help but think about how this package might be especially helpful for environmental scientists working with time series data.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the wateR blog! I’ve been considering starting a water-centric data science blog for a while now. Getting this blogdown website up and running has helped solidify my motivation to write regularly about water-related data science advances that are available to R users…and maybe Python users too (both languages are so useful!).
Some of the specific goals of this blog are to (in no special order):
 Practice developing my science communication and R skills.</description>
