# about me

I'm an Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) postdoctoral research fellow with the United States Forest Service (USFS). My current research with the USFS Southern Research Station focuses on linking hydrological models and demographics data to prioritize the location of climate change adaptation strategies for vulnerable communities in North Carolina.

I also like to help organize [R-Ladies RTP](https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-RTP/) events, help update the [R-Ladies Global](https://rladies.org/) website, voluneer at the [Durham Farmer's Market](http://www.durhamfarmersmarket.com/), explore the outdoors (hiking, biking, climbing, swimming), maintain my cultures ([kombucha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha) and [sourdough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourdough#Starter)), and cook/bake for friends.
