# Timeline
2017-current

# Project Goal
The goal of this project is to combine past and future hydrology model (i.e., [Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)](https://swat.tamu.edu/)) outputs with demographics data to create maps and prioritize climate change preparation and adaptation strategies for especially vulnerable communities in Western North Carolina's Upper Yadkin-Pee Dee Watershed.
