# Project Goal
The goal of this project was to use an exisiting process-based model (i.e., the [USDA WEPP model](http://wepp.ag.uidaho.edu/cgi-bin/HCT.pl) to develop a web-based hydrologic characterization tool (HCT) that could be used by water resources managers to evaluate the impact of agricultural best management practices on water quality (i.e., sediment, nutrients, and pesticides) for a region of interest. [Click here](http://wepp.ag.uidaho.edu/HCT_Motivation_Development_Background.pdf) for more information on the HCT.
