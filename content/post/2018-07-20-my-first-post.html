<p>Welcome to the wateR blog! I’ve been considering starting a water-centric data science blog for a while now. Getting this R-markdown website up and running has helped solidify my motivation to write regularly about water-related data science advances that are available to R users…and maybe Python users too (both are so useful!).</p>
<p><strong>Some of the specific goals of this blog are to (in no special order):</strong><br> * Practice my science communications skills.<br> * Review and demostrate new packages, datasets, and methods that might be useful to water resources research.<br> * Highlight newly published studies that use data science to advance water resources research.<br> * Discuss the present and future of water data science.<br> * Interviews with experts about water-related topics.<br></p>
