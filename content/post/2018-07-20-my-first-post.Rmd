Welcome to the wateR blog! I've been considering starting a water-centric data science blog for a while now. Getting this R-markdown website up and running has helped solidify my motivation to write regularly about water-related data science advances that are available to R users...and maybe Python users too (both are so useful!).

**Some of the specific goals of this blog are to (in no special order):**<br>
* Practice my science communications skills.<br>
* Review and demostrate new packages, datasets, and methods that might be useful to water resources research.<br>
* Highlight newly published studies that use data science to advance water resources research.<br>
* Discuss the present and future of water data science.<br>
* Interviews with experts about water-related topics.<br>
